Automatic Detection of MGD Level. Diagnosing MGD.

This scientific research is containing a thesis entitled "AUTOMATIC DETECTION OF MGD LEVEL" and a working software for calculating MGD Level.

**Update (June 12, 2024):**
Before starting this research, I've made some search on the Web about the topic. I've seen that there is a call for developers/scientists with the title: "The International Workshop on Meibomian Gland Dysfunction.". So I felt like I joined an international workshop remotely. I knew I had to write a thesis but the most important thing was that there must be a working software at the end. Since this research is committed to the medicine area, the developed software is AI-Free. The results are 100% accurate. The methods used are the most basic Computer Science algorithms: Forming line charts and finding local maximum and minimum. These methods are supported by manual editing to help the physician. 100% Accuracy of the results is tested many times. 

Since this research is a commitment to medicine area, I can't see it valuable for me. But if it is applied to the real world, and physicians use it for real cases, I'd just be happy and hopeful that success of this research will support me someday.
