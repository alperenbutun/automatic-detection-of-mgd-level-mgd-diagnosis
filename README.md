**Update (June 12, 2024):**
Before starting this research, I've made some search on the Web about the topic. I've seen that there is a call for developers/scientists with the title: "The International Workshop on Meibomian Gland Dysfunction.". So I felt like I joined an international workshop remotely and internationally. I knew I had to write a thesis but the most important thing was that there must be a working software at the end. Since this research is committed to the medicine field, the software developed at the end is AI-Free. The results are 100% accurate. The methods used are very basic CS algorithms: Forming line charts and finding local maximum and minimum. This methods are supported by manual editting tools to help the physicians. 100% Accuracy of the results of the software is tested many times. 

Since this research is a contribution to medicine field, I can't see this work valuable. But if it is applied to real world, or physicians use it for real cases, I'd just be happy and hopeful that success of this work will support me someday.

There is one file in total.
