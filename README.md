Automatic Detection of MGD Level. Diagnosing MGD.

This scientific research is containing a thesis entitled "AUTOMATIC DETECTION OF MGD LEVEL" and a working software for calculating MGD Level.

**Update (June 12, 2024):**
Before starting this research, I've made some search on the Web about the topic. I've seen that there is a call for developers/scientists with the title: "The International Workshop on Meibomian Gland Dysfunction". So I felt like I joined an international workshop remotely. I knew I had to write a thesis but the most important thing was that there must be a working software at the end. Since this research is committed to the medicine area, results of the software are 100% accurate. The methods used are basic Computer Science algorithms: Forming line charts and finding local maximum, minimum. 

Since this research is a commitment to medicine area, I can't see it valuable for me. However, if it is applied to the real world, and physicians use it for real cases, I'd just be happy and hopeful that success of this research will support me someday.

In summary, the software scientifically computes and classifies the front and back sides of a grayscale image. It can be also used in different areas.
